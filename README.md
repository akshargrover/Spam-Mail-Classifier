## Spam Mail Classifier
This project is a Spam Mail Classifier designed to categorize email messages as either Spam or Not Spam using Logistic Regression. The classifier analyzes the text of emails to determine the likelihood of them being spam based on various features.

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to provide an efficient and lightweight spam detection system using Logistic Regression. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and statistical methods, the classifier identifies common patterns in spam messages and accurately distinguishes them from legitimate emails.

Features

Preprocessing of text data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).

Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Logistic Regression for binary classification.

Lightweight and interpretable model.

Accuracy evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

Technologies Used

Python

scikit-learn

NumPy

pandas

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
